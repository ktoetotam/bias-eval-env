# Cross-Language Analysis Success Summary

## âœ… Problem Solved: Cross-Language Metrics in CLI

### Original Issue
The CLI was not showing cross-language analysis metrics when evaluating with multiple languages (`languages=["en","de"]`).

### Root Cause
The `examples()` method was yielding examples in language-grouped order (all German first, then all English), so when CLI took the first 6 examples, it only got examples from one language.

### Solution Implemented
1. **Modified `examples()` method** to interleave examples from different languages:
   - German example 0, English example 0, German example 1, English example 1, etc.
   - Ensures balanced language sampling for any number of examples

2. **Enhanced AggregateResult** with cross-language metrics:
   - `cross_language_agreement`: Overall agreement percentage across language pairs
   - Stored language-specific details in metadata to avoid CLI display conflicts

### Test Results
```bash
uv run vf-eval bias-consistency -a '{"languages": ["en", "de"]}' -b http://localhost:11434/v1 -m llama3:8b-instruct-q4_K_M -n 6
```

**Output now includes:**
```
cross_language_agreement: avg - 1.000, std - 0.000
r1: [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]
r2: [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]
r3: [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]
```

This shows **100% cross-language agreement** - the model gave consistent responses across English and German versions of the same questions.

### How It Works
- **Example Selection**: First 6 examples = 3 German + 3 English (interleaved)
- **Question Pairing**: Each question ID (000, 001, 002) appears in both languages
- **Agreement Calculation**: For each question pair, check if German and English responses match
- **Final Metric**: Percentage of question pairs where languages agreed

### Benefits
1. **Bias Detection**: Can now identify when models respond differently to the same question in different languages
2. **CLI Integration**: Works seamlessly with existing verifiers framework
3. **Balanced Sampling**: Ensures fair representation of all specified languages
4. **Statistical Rigor**: Provides quantitative measure of cross-language consistency

The bias consistency environment now provides comprehensive cross-language analysis both in Python API and CLI!
